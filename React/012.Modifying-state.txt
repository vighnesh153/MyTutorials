Special thing about 'state' variable is that if we modify it, then that
component instance, whose 'state' is modified, get's re-rendered. Updating the
'state' calls the 'render' method of the instance.

How to modify 'state' variable?

class Person extends Component {
    state = {
        number: 123
    }

    changeNumber() {
        this.state.number = 321;   // This is not allowed.

        // state should only be modified by using 'setState' method which was
        // inherited from 'Component'. If we try to modify the state using the
        // above procedure, then it won't work. Use the below procedure:

        this.setState(
            {
                number: 321
            }
        );
        // NOTE: Only object should be passed to 'setState' method because
        // whatever object we pass to it will be merged with the 'state' object.
    }
}
