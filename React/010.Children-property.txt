If we pass something in the opening and closing tag of out component, then that
will be saved under {props.children}.

For example:
    <Person name='Vighnesh' age='21' >I am a child </Person>

    function Person(props) {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Name: { props.name }</h1>
                <p>Age: { props.age }</p>
                <p>Children: {props.children} </p>
            </div>
        );
    }

    NOTE: The above function uses the 'props.children' property. If we create
          a JSX tag of it, and not pass anything as children, or use it as a
          self-closing tag, then the 'props.children' will have null or empty
          value.

    NOTE: If we pass other JSX component tag as a child to another JSX tag, it
          will call its respective component handler, nothing special.
