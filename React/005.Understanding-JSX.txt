JSX -> JavaScript + XML

It is basically used for components creation inside the React-DOM.

It looks just like HTML but it is not HTML. It is just a syntactic sugar for
creating components using objects.

For example,

let component = (
    <div>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1 id="okok">Hello</h1>
        <h1 class="okok">Hello</h1>
    </div>
);

Following is the equivalent of the above JSX. Basically when compiling, the
above code is converted to the following code anyway.

let component = React.createElement(
    'div', null, React.createElement('h1', null, "Hello"),
                 React.createElement('h1', {id: "okok"}, null, "Hello"),
                 React.createElement('h1', {class="okok"}, "Hello")
);


React.createElement() : Can take infinite elements
    arguments =>
        1. First argument: Element name. If an HTML element, enclose in quotes.
                           If JSX component, use without quotes
        2. Second argument: JavaScript object, where each key in the object will
                            correspond to an HTML/JSX attribute of the first argument.
        3. All other arguments: They are children of the first argument and siblings
                                of each other.
