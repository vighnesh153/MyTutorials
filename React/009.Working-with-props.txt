'props' is a conventional name given to property-attributes of JSX.

For example,

If we pass some attributes in a component, it is passed to its function-based or
class-based component definition. In the function-based component definition,
it is passed as a property of an object which is passed to the function.
In the class-based component definition, it is gets stored as a key of 'this.props'
object.

Following usage will clear things up.


<Person name='Vighnesh' age='21' />


In function-based component definition:
    function Person(props) {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Name: { props.name }</h1>
                <p>Age: { props.age }</p>
            </div>
        );
    }

In class-based component definition:
    class Person extends Component {
        render()
        {
            return (
              <div>
                  <h1>Name: { this.props.name }</h1>
                  <p>Age: { this.props.age }</p>
              </div>
            );
        }
    }
