1. UI state becomes difficult to handle with Vanilla JavaScript.
2. Focus on business logic, not on preventing our app from exploding.
3. Huge ecosystem, active community, high performance.

NOTE: React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with
      other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time,
      and how the data is prepared for display. Instead of artificially
      separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files,
      React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components”
      that contain both.

NOTE: React doesn’t require using JSX (what JSX is, is discussed in file with
      index == 005), but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when
      working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to
      show more useful error and warning messages.
