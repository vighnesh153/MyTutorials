Suppose, we have reducers as follows:

```js
const reducer1 = (state = { a: 1 }, action) => {
    // ...
};

const reducer2 = (state = { b: 1 }, action) => {
    // ...
};
```

And we combined then like following:

```js
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    reducerOne: reducer1,
    reducerTwo: reducer2,
});
```

To access the state properties, we need to add the name of the reducer used in
`rootReducer` after `state`.

To access `a`
```js
const a = state.reducerOne.a;
```

To access `b`
```js
const b = state.reducerTwo.b;
```
