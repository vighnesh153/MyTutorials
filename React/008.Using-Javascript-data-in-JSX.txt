To use JavaScript variables inside JSX, we simply wrap them in single curly braces.
We can even call functions inside them.

For example:

ex.1:
let age = 21;
let component = (
    <p>I am a person. My age is { age }.</p>
);

ex.2
function calculateAge()
{
    // Some calculation
    return 21;
}
let component = (
    <p>I am a person. My age is { calculateAge() }.</p>
);
