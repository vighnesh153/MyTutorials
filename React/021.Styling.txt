To style, either write style in a CSS file and import it in the JS file and give
appropriate class names to the elements.
NOTE: This way, the styles are not scoped to the component importing them. So,
      they will be applied to all the elements in the Application which match the
      selectors in the stylesheet. We can use BEM convention to tackle this issue.


Or, create a style object and use it as follows:
(But this way is a but difficult like creating a hover effect and so on.
 So, it is recommended to use CSS files)
	const style = {
		backgroundColor: 'red',
		border: '1px solid blue'
	};

	<button
		style={ style }
	>Click Me</button>
