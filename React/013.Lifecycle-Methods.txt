Lifecycle methods are special methods on the Component class that run some
code when a component mounts or unmounts.

1. componentDidMount() { } => This method runs after the component output has
                              been rendered to the DOM.

2. componentWillUnmount() { } => This method will run when the component is about to unmount.


3. componentWillMount() { } => This method is called before the component's render method is called
                                for the first time.
            NOTE: This is not recommended. Constructor should be used to initialize the component
                  instead of using this method.
