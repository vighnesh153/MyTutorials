### Hooks
1. `useState` <br/>
Iske baare mei bhi likhna padega kya?
1. `useEffect` <br/>
```js
useEffect(() => {
    // Runs whenever values in dependency array changes

    return () => {
        // AKA clean up function
        // Runs if the function, passed to useEffect,
        // is going to run again due to change
        // in deps array.
        // It also runs if the component is being unmounted from the DOM.
    };
}, []);
```
1. `useCallback` <br/>
Caches the function, based on the deps array.
Needed because if a component re-renders, then
the function-expressions defined in the component,
are re-created. If we are using this function expression
as a dependency in some `useEffect`, then every time the
component runs, the function is re-created, and the
`useEffect` runs again. To avoid this, we use
`useCallback`.
```js
const someFunc = useCallback((...args) => {
    // do something here
}, []);
```
