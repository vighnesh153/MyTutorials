### Introduction
* Used for server-side rendering.


### Documentation
Awesome docs. Trust me, no need of a video course (if you already know good enough React).
* For utter Beginners: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app

### Installation (from scratch)

### Installation (on an existing `create-react-app` application)
> Required >= react:16
```
npm i -S next react react-dom
```

### Setup
* In `package.json`:
    ```json
    {
        ...,
        "scripts": {
            "dev": "next",
            "build": "next build",
            "start": "next start"
        }
        ...,
    }
    ```
* Create a `pages` directory in the root.
> Manage routes by having a route-like folder structure in the `pages` directory.

const el = (
    <Link href-"/auth">
