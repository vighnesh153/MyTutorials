* To create,
```js
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';
class MyComponent extends PureComponent {

}
```
instead of
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class MyComponent extends Component {

}
```
* `PureComponent` implements a `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method by performing
a shallow comparision on the `props` and `state` of the component.
* If there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered => **performance boost**
* It is a good idea to ensure that all the children components are also `pure` to avoid
unexpected behaviour.
* Never mutate the state. Always return a new object that reflects the new state.
