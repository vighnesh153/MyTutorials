Class based components have a special instance variable called 'state'. It is
inherited from the 'Component' class.

We can override it by assigning it values as an object (only once: either in
constructor or as a free property outside any function -> discussed below).
NOTE: It should only be assigned an object. (As per React. Why? Discussed later)

For example:

    class App extends Component {
        state = {
            persons: [
                { name: "Vighnesh", age: 21},
                { name: "llod", age: 21},
            ]
        };

        render() {
            return (
                  <div>
                    <Person name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age} />
                    <Person name={this.state.persons[1].name} age={this.state.persons[1].age} />
                  </div>
            );
        }
    }
