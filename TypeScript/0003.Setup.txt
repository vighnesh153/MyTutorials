1. Download a code editor ( Sublime, Visual Studio Code, Atom, notepad++, etc. )
2. Install node.
3. Create a project folder and open the folder in both, the editor and terminal.
4. In terminal, run => $ npm init
5. In terminal, run => $ npm install -g typescript
6. To compile the TS file, in the command-prompt, run => $ npx tsc file.ts
	(Doing this will convert the TS file to file.js)



DEVELOPMENT/PROFESSIONAL WAY:
	1. Same till step 5 of previous method.
	2. Create a 'tsconfig.json' file in the same folder using => $ tsc --init
	3. The above command will generate a file that has all the supported properties. Most of them
	   are commented. Uncomment them and specify their values as per your need.
	4. Run 'tsc' in the terminal. It will look for the 'tsconfig.json' file and execute according
	   to the requirements specified by the user in the 'tsconfig.json' file.
