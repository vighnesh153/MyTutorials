TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, was created to address problems with JavaScript.


Problems with JavaScript:
	1. No type-check.
	2. Allows calling the function even if the number of parameters passed, doesn't match with the
	   number of arguments accepted by the function.


Another reasons to learn Typescript:
	1. Angular 2+ supports TypeScript. If we just use vanilla JS in Angular, then it will be a lot
	   of work to do.
	2. Even React will support/integrate TypeScript.
