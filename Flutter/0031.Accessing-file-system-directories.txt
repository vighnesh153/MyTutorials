Android and IOS don't allow to store data anywhere in the file system because
applications may just clutter up the hard-drive and it will be very difficult for
the user to clean up. So, the operating systems allow access to a special folder
known as app-data. There we can store the data. And when the user uninstalls the
app, the OS knows where to clean the app data from.


To get the app data folder information and access:
	Package:
		https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider

		Library to help with building of paths:
			https://pub.dev/packages/path



Imports:
	import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
	import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart' as sys_paths;


Usage:
	final appDir = await sys_paths.getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();

	// imageFile from the previous file
	final fileName = path.basename(imageFile.path);
