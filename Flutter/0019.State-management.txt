We do state management in Flutter by using the 'provider' package.

We basically attach the store to some widget, and then all the descendants of
that widget will have access to that store. So, it is usually a good idea
to attach the store at the main app so every widget has access to that store. Just
like in Angular, we provide 'Angular Services' in root.
