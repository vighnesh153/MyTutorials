Mixins are the classes that we, kind of inherit. Kind of inherit in the sense that
it adds some extra functionality, some utility methods, in the class.

Dart only supports single class inheritance. Hence, if we want to inherit from
multiple classes, we use mixins.

mixin SomeMixin {

}

class Base1 {

}

class Derieved extends Base1 with SomeMixin {

}
