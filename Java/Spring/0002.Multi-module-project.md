1. Create a normal maven project.
2. Delete the src directory.
3. In the pom.xml file, add `<packaging>pom</packaging>` below the `version` tag to specify it
	as a pom project. It is like making the pom.xml as a solution file in visual studio.
4. Right click on the project directory and add new Module (a module is nothing but a like a project
	existing in a solution in C#).
