Add a button in the hierarchy by right-clicking and going to UI=> Button.
If a canvas already exists, then add it to it by right clicking on the canvas,
else, a new canvas will be automatically created while adding the button.


Change the text:
	The button GameObject will have a Text GameObject as a child. To modify the
	text of the button, we have to modify the text in it. Add text style as required.


Event listener:
	At the bottom of the button in inspector, there will be a ButtonScript already attached to
	the button. There, you can find 'On Click()' list. Click the add sign next to it and to
	it, attach the GameObject from the hierarchy (usually the GameManager) that has the method which
	is supposed to be executed on Click. After attaching the game object, we need to select the
	script component of that game object which has the functionality of OnClick and select that
	method from the drop down. It is quite intuitive to attach the method. Observe the GUI carefully.


To Add a listener Programatically:
	restartButton.onClick.AddListener(MethodName);

To hold reference of button in the Script to enable and disable it:

	using UnityEngine.UI;

	public Button restartButton;

	restartButton.gameObject.SetActive(true);	// to enable. false to disable
