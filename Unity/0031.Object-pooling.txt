If we have objects that are instantiating a lot of times, it can be a performance hit.

To avoid that, we can in the beginning create a pool of max number of objects that will be
in the screen at a time. Store the instances of them in a queue.

Remove them from queue when they need to be used and when they are not needed, we can push them
back into the Queue so that they are back in pool to be used later. Remember to reset properties
before or after pushing/popping from the queue.
