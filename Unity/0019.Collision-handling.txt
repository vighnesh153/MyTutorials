When 2 colliders collides with a collider, a method is called

private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{

}

NOTE: Difference between OnTriggerEnter and OnCollisionEnter is that
	  if we set the OnTrigger of the body to true, then we have just marked a zone
	  to that body. Think of it as a ghost. It exists and it has a zone (outer walls
	  using the collider) but we can pass through it. As soon as we start passing
	  through it, OnTriggerEnter is called. OnCollisionEnter is called when the body is a
	  solid body and elastic collision is there. So if a body bounces of, it has collided.
	  So, OnCollisionEnter is called.
