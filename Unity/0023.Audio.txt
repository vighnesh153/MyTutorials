Add a audio source component to any game object. And to that attach the audio file.

Usually, the main camera has the audio listener(place from where the audio will be heard in the 3D
world). If we add the audio source component to the camera, there will be no feel like the sound is
coming from a distance. Sometime, that is what we want. But in FPS shooter games, we want to hear
the enemies coming close to us. So, we add the audio source to the enemies and audio listener to the
player.


NOTE:
// For background music, we don't need to play with the audio in the script. We can just
// add an audio source and play the audio on loop in the inspector itself.


To play audio from the script:

	// Add clips to the following in the inspector
	public AudioClip jumpSound;
	public AudioClip crashSound;

	// Add the empty audio source component in the inspector
	private AudioSource playerAudio;

	// Get the audio source component's reference
	playerAudio = GetComponent<AudioSource>();

	// To play the audio once:
	playerAudio.PlayOneShot(jumpSound, 1f);
    //						   Clip,  volume
