In the hierarchy, right click and add UI=>Text-TextMeshPro object.

That will create a 'canvas' game object in the hierarchy and add the text element to it.


using TMPro;

// To the following, attach the Text GameObject in the inspector
public TextMeshProUGUI scoreText;

private int score;

void Start()
{
    score = 0;
    scoreText.text = $"Score: {score}";
}
