// Mouse input:
// When a mouse event occurs on a gameobject, the following methods get called for respective events.

private void OnMouseDown() {}
private void OnMouseUp() {}
private void OnMouseEnter() {}
private void OnMouseExit() {}
private void OnMouseDrag() {}



void Update()
{

	// GetKey => returns true if the key is in pressed mode.
	// GetKeyDown => returns true only for the first time, key was down even when it is in pressed mode
	// GetKeyDown => the moment, key is up or released
	// NOTE: Some keyboards are not English or some keys don't exists on some
	// 		 keyboards. So, in that case, the following won't work. In that sceenario,
	// 		 we use GetButton() and specify buttons like 'jump', 'right', look up docs for more.
	// 		 These buttons are and can be pre-mapped to common keys. For eg. up can be mapped to 'W' and
	// 		 'Up Arrow', etc.
	if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow))
	{
		Debug.Log("Up Arrow was pressed!");
	}


	// ANOTHER WAY TO PROCESS INPUT
	float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
	// Value is between -1 and 1. If left/right arrow or
	// a/d keys are pressed, then horizontalInput will be 0.
	// If right key is pressed, it will be over 0 and <= 1.
	// If left key is pressed, it will be under 0 and >= -1.
	// To see these values:  go to
		Project Settings => Input => Axes
	// There we can find all sorts of values that are made available
	// on key presses.
