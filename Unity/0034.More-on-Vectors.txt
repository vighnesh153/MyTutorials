this.transform.LookAt(some_vector);
// Make the local forward of 'this' to point at 'some_vector';



float distance = Vector3.Distance(vector_1, vector_2);
// Euclidean distance between head points of 2 Vectors



float inDegrees = Vector3.Angle(vector_1, vector_2);
// Angle between 2 vectors



Debug.DrawRay(vector_1, vector_2)
// Helpful Debug trick: Draws ray between the heads of the 2 vectors in the Scene view
