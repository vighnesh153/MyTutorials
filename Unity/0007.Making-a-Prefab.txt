Prefab => Prefabricated object or in simple words, Preconfigured game objects.

Let us say, I have a game object to which I have attached a script, changed some transformations,
and other configurations. If I want to have the same object with same configurations somewhere else
or in some other scene, I create a prefab of it. Now, if I have instantiated that prefab, thousands of times,
and I want to make changes to all, I just need to change any one of them and all will get the same settings.



To create a prefab, create a prefabs directory in the Assets directory, just to keep things organized,
and then drag the game object from the hierarchy window to the prefab directory in the project window.



Ways to make changes to all instances of the prefab:
	1. Select the prefab from the 'PROJECT' window and make changes in the inspector window.

	2. Make changes in the inspector window of the instances in hierarchy. But this will not
	   apply the changes to all the instances. To apply the changes made to one instance to all
	   others, in the inspector window of the modified instance, there will be a 'overrides'
	   dropdown like button. Click that and it will ask if we want to revert all changes or apply
	   them to all the instances.
