How does load balancer check whether a server is alive or not busy ?

It uses heartbeat.

Heartbeat: The load balancer has an array of server IPs of the servers which are booked for serving
		   for a system. At regular intervals (eg. 5ms), the load balancer sends a tiny request
		   package to all the servers whose IP is stored in the array. If the server responds with
		   the expected response, then all good. But if the server fails to responds for 3-5 times,
		   then the server is not expected to respond to any client request and hence, is pronounced
		   dead. Its IP is removed from the active servers IP. After this, the server that was
		   pronounced dead, is restarted and then the server sends a request to the load balancer
		   saying that it is alive and ready to accept client requests. Then, the load balancer adds
		   the IP of the server to the standby array. Again a tiny request is sent to all servers
		   of the standby array and if for 3-5 times, they respond as expected, then their IPs are
		   added to the active servers array and then this process repeats.
