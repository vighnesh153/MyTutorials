Load balancer is a cluster of systems that serve the sole purpose of balancing the load as the name
suggests.


When we do horizontal scaling, there are multiple systems each with a different IP. We can't map
a domain name (abc.com) with multiple IPs. So, we map it with the load balancer's IP.

Load balancer stores an array of IPs of all the servers that are currently active. Whenever a
request arrives, it checks which server is not busy and which server is alive. Then, it forwards the
request to that server.
