    <h1>Euler's Totient Function:   </h1>
    <h2>It states that all positive integers, n, have a prime factorization as follows:</h2>

    <h2>then, the number of positive integers less than 'n' that are co-prime to 'n' is given
        by phi(n) where phi(n) is defined as follows:</h2>

    <h2>To prove the formula above, we use the help of 3 following lemmas:</h2>
    <hr>
    <h1>Lemma 1:</h1>
    <h2>Let G be the set as follows</h2>

    <h2>then, </h2>

    <h2>where, &nbsp;|A|&nbsp; is the number of elements in set A.</h2>
    <h1>Proof:</h1>
    <h2>We may use an example to prove the lemma instead of a variable but it is for simplicity purpose. For actual proof,
        just substitute in some variable in-place of the example number.</h2>
    <h3>Let n = 10.</h3>
    <h3>Number of positive integers co-prime to 10, and less than 10, are 4. Namely 1, 3, 7, 9.</h3>
    <h3>Now, if we add 10 to all the numbers of the above set, we get 11, 13, 17, 19.</h3>
    <h3>Or, we can write them as (10 + 1), (10 + 3), (10 + 7), (10 + 9).</h3>
    <h3>For all numbers in the above set, any prime factor, p, of 10 will not divide (10 + i) for i in (1, 3, 7, 9)
        as p divides 10 evenly but p is co-prime to all numbers in (1, 3, 7, 9) as all numbers in (1, 3, 7, 9) are
        co-prime to 10. So, (10 + i), for i in (1, 3, 7, 9), when divided by p, will always yield a remainder (can be proved
        by modular arithmetic). No matter how many times we add 10 to i, for i in (1, 3, 7, 9), (10x + i) will never be divisible
        by any prime factor of 10. So, in every interval of 10, there are 4 numbers, that are co-prime to 10.
        Hence, the total number of co-prime numbers to 10, and less than 10k, will be k times 4 (or phi(10)),
        which is 4k.</h3>

    <h1>Lemma 2:</h1>
    <h2>Let 'p' be a prime and 'p' divides 'n', then </h2>
    <img src="images/lemma2.png" alt="Please open the page in Chrome Browser">
    <h1>Proof:</h1>
    <h2>We may use an example to prove the lemma instead of a variable but it is for simplicity purpose. For actual proof,
        just substitute in some variable in-place of the example number.</h2>
    <h3>Let n = 10.</h3>
    <h3>Notice that all numbers that are co-prime to '10p' are also co-prime to '10' for obvious reasons.
        There are 'p' intervals, each with phi(10) numbers, relatively prime to '10p' or '10'. Hence, by lemma 1,
        phi(10p) = p*phi(10), for p in prime factors of 10 (2, 5).</h3>

    <h1>Lemma 3:</h1>
    <h2>Let 'p' be a prime and 'p' does not divide 'n', then </h2>
    <img src="images/lemma3.png" alt="Please open the page in Chrome Browser">
    <h1>Proof:</h1>
    <h2>We may use an example to prove the lemma instead of a variable but it is for simplicity purpose. For actual proof,
        just substitute in some variable in-place of the example number.</h2>
    <h3>Let n = 10.</h3>
    <h3>By lemma 2, we know that there are p*phi(10) number of elements, co-prime to '10' and less than '10p'.
        Notice that all the multiples of 'p' whose factors are co-prime to 10 are also counted for obvious reasons(don't proceed
        until this sinks in. It may take some time if you are reading this proof for the first time). To find those numbers,
        check the following statements: </h3>
    <h4>'p' is co-prime to 10</h4>
    <h4>(1, 3, 7, 9) are co-prime to 10.</h4>
    <h4>So, the product of 'i', for i in (1, 3, 7, 9), and 'p', will also be co-prime to 10.</h4>
    <h3>(p, 3p, 7p, 9p) are the only numbers, in the set of p*phi(10) numbers, that are co-prime to '10' but are not co-prime to
        '10p'. There are a total of phi(10) numbers, that are co-prime to 10 but not to '10p' because of the immediate previous
        statement. So, phi(10p) = p*phi(10) - phi(10)
        Hence, phi(10p) = (p-1)*phi(10), when p is not a prime factor of 10.</h3>
