What is a Probability Distribution?
	Probability distributions allow you to represent the probability of an event
	using a mathematical equation. Like any mathematical equation:
		probability distributions can be visualized using a graph especially in 2-dimensional cases.
		probability distributions can be worked with using algebra, linear algebra and calculus.

	These distributions make it much easier to understand and summarize the probability of a
	system whether that system be a coin flip experiment or the location of a self-driving car.

NOTE: In a continuous distribution, the probability of every event is 0. But we can
	  definitely define some probability for a range or an interval in the distribution space.
