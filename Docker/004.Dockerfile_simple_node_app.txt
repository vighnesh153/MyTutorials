# We copy the package.json from the project first so that,
# we can use the cached version of the containers that already contain
# the node modules installed. Why do that? Suppose, there is some change in
# our source code, then if we run `npm install` after all copying all the files,
# it won't used the cached version. But in this case, we were fine with the cached
# container that has the installed node modules. So, we use this pattern. This is
# done, just to save the time consumed while building a new version of the image.

COPY ./ ./

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]




# To build image, 'docker build -t username/app-name:tag .'
# To fire up the image and container: docker run -p 8153:3000 username/app-name
# First port is local machine port, and the second port is from inside the container.
