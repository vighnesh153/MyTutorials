Duck-typing: If it looks like a duck or quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.

Dynamic languages likes Python, JS, etc. have this.


Suppose we have a class A.
And Class B inherits class A.
Although, Class C doesn't inherit class A, but it defines/implements all the methods and properties
		of class A.
So, class C is considered an instance of class A.

NOTE: This doesn't work with statically typed languages like C++, C#, etc.
