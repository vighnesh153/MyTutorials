It is a way of moving common styles to a file.
The name of the file should start with an underscore and it is a common practice to
store all the partial files in a directory named 'partials'.

In 'partials/_fileName.scss', write all the common/required styles.

To import it in some other file,
    @import './partials/fileName';
NOTE: While importing, we don't add the underscore and the extension of the 'partial' file.
// The above line will be replaced with the content of 'partials/_fileName.scss' file.

NOTE: The import statement can be added at any line. There is no rule that it should be added
      at the top.

We don't include the SCSS files in the HTML. These files are meant to be included in other
SCSS files.
