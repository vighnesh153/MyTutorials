article:
	This tag is used to group together things, that are related to each other.

NOTE: We can even use the following instead of the article tag. It is equivalent to the article tag:
	<div class='article'>
	</div>
NOTE: We have to write styles for the 'article' class.

For example, lets say there is a blogs section.
In the blogs' section, there can be many blogs.
Each blog can be an article.
 Each blog has a title, image, content, etc.

<section class="blogs">

	<article id='blog-1'>
		<title>Blog 1</title>
		<img src="bla.bla.bla" />
		<p>
			This is my first blog.
		</p>
	</article>
	<article id='blog-2'>
		<title>Blog 2</title>
		<img src="bla.bla.bla" />
		<p>
			This is my second blog.
		</p>
	</article>
	<article id='blog-3'>
		<title>Blog 3</title>
		<img src="bla.bla.bla" />
		<p>
			This is my third blog.
		</p>
	</article>
