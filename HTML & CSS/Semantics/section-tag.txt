section:
	This tag is used to specify a group or literally a section.

For example,
	a navbar,
	an advertisements bar,
	a main content,
	etc.


NOTE: We can even use the following instead of the section tag. It is equivalent to the section tag:
	<div class='section'>
	</div>
NOTE: We have to write styles for the 'section' class.
