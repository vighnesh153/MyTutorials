Open Graphics Library is a cross-language, cross-platform application
programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

It is just a specification.
Basically, it just lists what functions should be implemented and
what they should do or what their behavior should be.

Graphics card manufacturers are the ones that implement these specifications
when developing their graphics card drivers.

The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit,
to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

OpenGL is cross-platform. It means that code written using it on any platform
would run on any other platform as well.

Other alternatives of OpenGL are:
    DirectX => Windows-specific
    Vulkan => cross-platform
    Metal => Apple products specific
