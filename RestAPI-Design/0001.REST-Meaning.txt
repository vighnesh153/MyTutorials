REST -> REpresentational State Transfer


REST Api:
	1. Separate client and server
	2. Server should be stateless
	3. Caching capability (Cacheable requests)
	4. Uniform interface


REST Api vs RESTful Api:
	1. RESTful Api is the one that has all the above mentioned 4 behaviors whereas,
	   REST Api is the one that tries to incorporate all the above behaviors but it
	   doesn't matter if all the behaviors are not included/supported.
	2. RESTful Api are very difficult to make.

People often use RESTful and REST Api interchangeably but when they do, they often mean
REST Api rather than RESTful.
