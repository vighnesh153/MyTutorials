Dict comprehensions have been synced-up with dict literals so that the key is computed first and
the value second:
	a = { input(): input() for _ in range(12) }





Dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7+





Calculate Euclidean distance:
	X = (1, 2, 3) # In 3 D
	Y = (4, 5, 6) # In 3 D
	D = math.dist(X, Y)

	# Both X and Y should have same dimensions.
	# There is no dimension limit





Product of all values:
	a = [3, 2, 5]
	math.prod(a)
	# 30

	math.prod(a, start=5)
	# 120
	# Default start is 1.





Added two new combinatoric functions math.perm() and math.comb():
	math.perm(10, 3)	# Permutations of 10 things taken 3 at a time
	# 720

	math.comb(10, 3)    # Combinations of 10 things taken 3 at a time
	# 120
