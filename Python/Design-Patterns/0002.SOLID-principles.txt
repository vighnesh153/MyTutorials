S -> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O -> Open-Closed: Open for extensibility (by inheritance), Closed for modification
L -> Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived class object should be able to
                                          be assigned to a base class variable
                                          without breaking anything.
I -> Interface integration (Many specific interfaces are better than one do-it-all interface)
D -> Dependency Inversion (Program towards abstraction, not implementation)
