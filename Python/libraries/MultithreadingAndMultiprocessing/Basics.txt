Differences:
	Multi-Threading: (Isn't actually parallism but pretends to be)
		1. Defines threads of a process, and execute them when the CPU is idle, one at a time.
		2. Acts on same global address space of parent.
		3. Economical in both, sense of time as well as resource consumption.
	Multi-Processing:(Actual parallellism)
		1. Processes different processes on different CPU cores.
		2. Different memory address space of each process
		   (Makes copies of globals and doesn't affect the originals)
		3. Time consuming and intense resource consumption.
