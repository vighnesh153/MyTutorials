Numpy is an array manipulation library that is C-optimized for using in Python.
It has many functionalities that are readily not available in Python.


import numpy as np


np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)   # To avoid truncation of large arrays while printing
                                             # import sys first.

a = np.empty((2, 3))
# empty array with 2 rows and 3 columns
# each of its index will have garbage float values as the array is not initialized.



a = np.arange(0, 10, 1.5)
# similar to the Python's 'range' function, except that this also accepts floating steps.



# Math Functions
a = np.pi  # 3.1415926535...
a = np.sin(x)   # x => radians
a = np.sin([x1, x2, ...])  => returns array of values, where each value is sin(xi)    # xi => radians
a = np.nan  # similar to float('nan')
