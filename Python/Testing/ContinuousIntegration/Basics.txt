# Continuous Integration (CI) is a way to do automated testing on a remote environment.
# It helps us in following way:
#	1. It doesn't waste our developer time.
#	2. There is no bias in running the code. eg. no developer's system defaults that maybe made the code run.

# To do continuous integration using TravisCI, add the repo in the TravisCI's website

# Run =>  'pip freeze > requirements.txt'.
# Modify the test file's name in the .travis.yml sample, attached, according to the used test file.
# Then add the .travis.yml file in the repo.
# Then push to the repo
