In the package.json file, the object has a property: 'scripts'.
It's value is an object.
Each of that object's keys is a command and its value specifies what we want to do, when we run that command.

Example:
	{
		"scripts": {
			"start": "ls -la"
		}
	}

	Now, in terminal, when I type 'npm start', 'ls -la will be run'.


But the list of commands is predefined. All the commands available can be viewed using 'npm display'
