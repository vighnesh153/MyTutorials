NodeJS is basically a library that allows us to use the V8 engine without the need of a browser.
So, we can run JavaScript on our machine without the need of a browser.

This allowed us to write scripts that run on the machine which would help us to use asynchronous JS
on the machine which led to the rise of backend-development in NodeJS.
