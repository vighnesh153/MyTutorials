High level design of a system focusses on the cloud and devops things.

Things like:
	1. Scalability (Comes in vertical and horizontal scaling)
	2. High response time
	3. Consistency (Data from each DB of all the different servers are in sync. For example, if
					server 1 served an user on day 1 and on day 2, server 2 serves him, then
					the data that he updated on the server 1 should be retrievable from server 2 as
					well.)
	4. Replication (Data should be replicated so as to account for fault tolerance)
	5. Vertical scaling (Increasing the specs of a single machine)
	6. Horizontal scaling (Increasing the number of machines with not so high specs but together
						they can serve a lot many requests.)
	7. Sharding (With most huge systems, data does not fit on a single machine. In such cases,
				sharding refers to splitting the very large database into smaller, faster and more
				manageable parts called data shards)
