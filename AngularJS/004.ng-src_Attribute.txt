Consider a controller as follows:

let app = angular
                .module("nameOfModule", [])
                .controller("nameOfController", function($scope) {
                    let flag = "images/ok.png"
                    $scope.flag = flag;
                });


Now, if we use it as follows:

<body ng-app="nameOfModule">
    <div ng-controller="nameOfController">
        <img src="{{ flag }}" />
    </div>
</body>

Then, the image loads, but we have a '404 error' in the console as well. This is because,
when the DOM parses the HTML page, it sends a request to the "{{ flag }}" URL which is not a
valid path as flag is not evaluated until the script is parsed. Parsing of DOM, occurs before the
evaluation of the Angular modules and controllers.

But as soon as they are evaluated, again a request is made to the valid URL which was passed to
the flag variable.

But because of this, 2 requests were made and an error was thrown for the failure of first request.
To avoid 2 requests and failure, we use 'ng-src' attribute instead of 'src' so that the image from the URL
is requested only after the script is parsed and 'ng' components are available.

eg.

<body ng-app="nameOfModule">
    <div ng-controller="nameOfController">
        <img ng-src="{{ flag }}" />
    </div>
</body>
