'ng-click' works in the similar way as the 'onclick' attribute of HTML.
The advantage of use ng-click is that we can use variables/functions that are
attached to the 'scope' of the controller. But we can't access those in the 'onclick'
HTML attribute.

Syntax is same to the 'onclick' attribute of HTML element.
