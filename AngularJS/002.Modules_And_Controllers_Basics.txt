1. Module: Tells the page to use user defined controllers on the page.

To create a module: make a new JS file (conventional to keep core-JS code in different file)

var myApp = angular.module("nameOfModule", []);
// The 2nd arg is an array of other modules. (More on this later)



2. Controller: Binds some data to the scope where it is used

myApp.controller("nameOfController", function($scope) {
    $scope.someVariable = someValue;
});
// $scope is the object that is passed to the above controller when called.
// It is the scope of the html element in which it is used.




USAGE:

<body ng-app="nameOfModule">
// Binds 'myApp' module with body

    <div ng-controller="nameOfController">
        {{ someVariable }}
    </div>
    // someVariable is only available in the above div's scope as it is binded with 'nameOfController'
    
</body>
