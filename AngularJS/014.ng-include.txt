'ng-include' directive is used to embed/render an HTML page into another HTML page.

This technique is extremely useful when we want to reuse a specific view in multiple
pages in our application.

The value for the 'ng-include' directive will be the name of the HTML page that we
want to embed/render within another HTML page. It can also be passed as a '$scope'
property from the controller.

eg.

<div ng-include="'index.html'"></div>
OR
<div ng-include="homePage"></div>  // $scope.homePage should be defined in the controller.
