Sorting in angularJS is also a type of filter.


ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:certainPropertyOfEmployee:reverse"

// 'certainPropertyOfEmployee' needs to be a property of all 'emp' object in employees.
// reverse can be either true or false.

eg.

        ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name:true"  // if 'reverse' not specified, defaults to false

        ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name:false"
        => same as =>  ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name"


        We can even use '+'/'-' for ascending and descending ordering.

        ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name:false"
        => same as =>  ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:+name"
        => same as =>  ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name"

        ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:name:true"
        => same as =>  ng-repeat="emp in employees | orderBy:-name"
