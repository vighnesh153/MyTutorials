It is similar to a for-each loop. We can iterate over collections using it in the
binding expression.

NOTE: Even if we are iterating over array, we use the 'in' keyword in the 'ng-repeat'
attribute. It is because it is not the pure javascript's 'in'. It is the keyword made
by angualar to be used only in its interface.

We can also access the index of the iteration element. To access it, use '$index' variable.


To get the index of the parent loop/repetition, use '$parent.$index'
Another way, to initialize the index of the parent repetition, we can use the 'ng-init' attribute.
eg.
<li ng-repeat="employee in employees" ng-init="parentIndex=$index">
</li>
The variable 'parentIndex' will be available only within the 'li' in which it was initialized.



Jumping right into the syntax:

        <body ng-app="nameOfModule">
        <div ng-controller="nameOfController">
            <ul>
                <li ng-repeat="employee in employees">
                    Name: {{ employee.name }}
                    <ul>
                        <li ng-repeat="place in employee.placesLivedIn">
                            {{ place }}, Index: {{ $index }}, Parent-Index: {{ $parent.$index }}
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
                let myApp = angular
                        .module("nameOfModule", [])
                        .controller("nameOfController", function($scope) {
                            $scope.employees = [
                              {
                                name: "Vighnesh",
                                placesLivedIn: ["Mumbai", "Bengaluru", "Pune", "Goa"]
                              },
                              {
                                name: "Please",
                                placesLivedIn: ["Don't know", "Nope", "XD", "U suck"]
                              }
                            ];
                        });
        </script>



Some special properties:

$index: gives index of the iteration (0-based)
$first: 'true' if the current iteration is the first iteration.
$last: 'true' if the current iteration is the last iteration.
$middle: 'true' if the current iteration is not 'first' and not 'last'
$even: 'true' if '$index' is even
$odd: 'true' if '$index' is odd
