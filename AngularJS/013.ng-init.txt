'ng-init' directive is basically used to initialize variables in the HTML (view) file.

eg.

<div ng-init="employee = {
                            name: 'Vighnesh',
                            age: 21
                         }">
        // 'employee' is now available to be used inside any binding expression
        // only in this block.
</div>


It is not a good practice to initialize variables in the 'views' file. Initialization should be
done in the 'controller'.

'ng-init' should only be used for aliasing special properties of 'ng-repeat' directive.
