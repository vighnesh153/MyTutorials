To create a new page, just add another page to the `pages` directory and you can
access that page on `/page-name` route. We don't need to use router and all to build
routes.

To create a link to different page:
```js
import Link from 'gatsby-link';

const MyLink = (path, name) => (
    <Link to={ path }>{ name }</Link>
)
// <MyLink path="/about" name="About" />

export default MyLink;
```
