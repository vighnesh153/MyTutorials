JavaScript can be executed in time-intervals.
This is called timing events.

NOTE: ALL THE BELOW METHODS BELONG TO THE WINDOW OBJECT. BUT AS ALWAYS, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE
	  THE 'window.' PREFIX FOR GLOBALS.

let timeoutVariable = setTimeout(function, milliseconds);
// Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

let intervalVariable = setInterval(function, milliseconds)
// Executes the function after every 'milliseconds' number of milliseconds


clearTimeout(timeoutVariable);
// stops the execution of the function specified in setTimeout()

clearInterval(intervalVariable)
// stops the executions of the function specified in the setInterval() method
