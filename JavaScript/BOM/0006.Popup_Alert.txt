JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.


ALERT BOX
	An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
		window.alert("sometext");
			or
		alert("sometext");

	NOTE: LINE BREAK IS ALLOWED IN ALERT BOX
	alert("Hello\nHow are you?");


CONFIRM BOX
	A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
	When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
	If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.

	window.confirm("sometext");

	EXAMPLE
	if (confirm("Press a button!")) {
	  txt = "You pressed OK!";
	} else {
	  txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
	}


PROMPT BOX
	A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
	When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after
	entering an input value. If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user
	clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.

	window.prompt("sometext","defaultText");

	EXAMPLE
	var person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
	if (person == null || person == "") {
	  txt = "User cancelled the prompt.";
	} else {
	  txt = "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
	}
