THE HTMLCOLLECTION OBJECT
	The getElementsByTagName() method returns an HTMLCollection object.
	An HTMLCollection object is an array-like list (collection) of HTML elements.

	The following code selects all <p> elements in a document:
		var x = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

	The elements in the collection can be accessed by an index number.
	To access the second <p> element you can write:
		y = x[1];
		(index starts with 0)


HTMLCOLLECTION LENGTH
	document.getElementsByTagName("p").length
	// number of elements in the HTMLCollection


NOTE: AN HTMLCOLLECTION IS NOT AN ARRAY!
	An HTMLCollection may look like an array, but it is not.
	You can loop through the list and refer to the elements with a number (just like an array).
	However, you cannot use array methods like valueOf(), pop(), push(), or join() on an HTMLCollection.
