In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
	Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
	Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
	Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
	Dates are always objects
	Maths are always objects
	Regular expressions are always objects
	Arrays are always objects
	Functions are always objects
	Objects are always objects

NOTE: ALL JAVASCRIPT VALUES, EXCEPT PRIMITIVES, ARE OBJECTS.


JAVASCRIPT PRIMITIVES
	A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
	A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
	JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
		string
		number
		boolean
		null
		undefined

NOTE: PRIMITIVE VALUES ARE IMMUTABLE (THEY ARE HARDCODED AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE CHANGED).
Example:
	5 = 12 is invalid,
	true = 45 is invalid, etc.


OBJECTS ARE VARIABLES
	JavaScript variables can contain single values:
		eg. let person = "John Doe";

	Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
	The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
		let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

	A JAVASCRIPT OBJECT IS A COLLECTION OF NAMED VALUES


OBJECT PROPERTIES
	The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.
		Property	Value
		firstName	John
		lastName	Doe
		age			50
		eyeColor	blue


	Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:
		Associative arrays in PHP
		Dictionaries in Python
		Hash tables in C
		Hash maps in Java
		Hashes in Ruby and Perl


OBJECT METHODS
	An object method is an object property containing a function definition.


CREATING A JAVASCRIPT OBJECT
	1. var person = {
		  firstName: "John",
		  lastName: "Doe",
		  age: 50,
		  eyeColor: "blue"
		};
	2. var person = new Object();
	   person.firstName = "John";
	   person.lastName = "Doe";
	   person.age = 50;
	   person.eyeColor = "blue";


NOTE: OBJECTS ARE MUTABLE: THEY ARE ADDRESSED BY REFERENCE, NOT BY VALUE.
	Example:
	var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}
	var x = person;
	x.age = 10;           // This will change both x.age and person.age
