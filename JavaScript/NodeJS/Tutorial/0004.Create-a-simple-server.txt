const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer();
server.listen(8088);

// We have created a simple server that listens on port '8088'. But it does nothing. Not even respond
// to anything.


Although, the 'createServer' method also accepts a function that takes 2 arguments: one to which the
        request information will passed, and the other, to help us build our response. Response to the
        request will be sent by the server using the 'response' object whose values we modify to build
        our desired response.

        const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {

            // 'writeHead' for modifying headers
            response.writeHead(200, { 'Content': 'text/plain'});

            // 'write' for setting the body
            response.write('Hello, Vighnesh!');

            // To end the response construction
            response.end();

            // This will make all the process that are listening to stop once
            // this line is hit. It will shut down our application. Not used
            // often but it is good to know.
            process.exit();
        });
        // The above function accepts all the requests and sends a response as '200 OK' and body as
        // body, 'Hello, Vighnesh!'.
