What are sockets?
    Imagine a socket in real life. It is something to which insert a plug of some kind.
    For example, socket on the wall we use to plug our phone charger that connects our
    phone to the housing circuitry.

    Similar to the real life sockets, sockets are used to connect a client to the server.
    There are 2 different protocols:
        1. Http protocol: A client requests something from the server and the server responds
                          the client with the appropriate response and then the connection is
                          closed.
        2. Web socket protocol: It is an enhancement to the Http protocol. Unlike http protocol,
                                the web socket protocol keeps the connection with the server alive.
                                Common use cases => Online multiplayer games, chat applications, etc.
                                We can also use this to keep the client in-sync with the server instead
                                of sending multiple requests after every interval, we can keep the client
                                connected to the server until the client wishes to terminate the
                                connection.
