Installation:
  npm i -D nodemon


Usage:
  nodemon app.js
  // Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and
  // automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Just use 'nodemon'
  // instead of 'node' to run your code, and now your process will automatically
  // restart when your code changes.



But this won't restart the debugger if we make changes to the file while debugging.
So, for that to work, we open the '.vs/launch.json' and in the object, we add the
following properties:
  "restart": true,
  "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon"
  "console": "integratedTerminal"
// This works for 'VsCode'. Check 'nodemon' docs for other IDEs.
// But then, we would need to intall 'nodemon' globally for it to work.
