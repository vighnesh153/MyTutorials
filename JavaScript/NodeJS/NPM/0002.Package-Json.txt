'package.json' is a file that stores all the information about the node package.
If a directory contains package.json, then it is a package.

We can configure many things inside it.

To create a npm package:
  1. Create a target directory.
  2. Then 'cd' into it.
  3. Then run: npm init (Following all the questions, it will create a package.json in the directory with
                      selected options)
