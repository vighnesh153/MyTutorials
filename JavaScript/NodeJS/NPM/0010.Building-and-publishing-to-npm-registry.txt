// Choose any CI provider. In this, I am using TravisCI.
9. Create a TravisCI account and connect it the Github repo to it.
    Go to this page: https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories for more info on how to connect.

10. In the settings of the Github repo, add a protection-rule to the branch you
    want to protect from direct merges.

    Make sure to add/select the following in the protection-rules:
      Check: Required status checks to pass before merging. In that, check 'Travis CI - pull request'.
      Check: Include administrators: Enforce all configured restrictions above for administrators.
