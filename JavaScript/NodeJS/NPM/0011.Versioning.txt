If current version is a.b.c, then the npm version updates it in the following way:

Command:
  npm version patch
  // Increments the 'c' value


  npm version minor
  // Increments the 'b' value


  npm version major
  // Increments the 'a' value


NOTE: The 'npm version xxx' also adds a version to the git commits. So, if we view it
      on Github, then we can see in the releases section that the current commit is tagged
      as a new version.
