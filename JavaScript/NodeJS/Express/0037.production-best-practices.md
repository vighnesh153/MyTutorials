Process Managers:

    NPM process-manager package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2

    Popular Process Manager: http://strong-pm.io/
    (PM helps in restarting application if it crashes. And much more.)

    Best service manager: https://wiki.debian.org/systemd
    (Service manager helps in starting the process manager if OS crashes and restarts.)
    (But service managers cannot handle application restarts. Therefore, we use PM
        that can handle app crashes and we make sure that PM is always running even
        after OS crash and restart with the help of service managers)
