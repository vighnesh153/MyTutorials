For sending images or non-JSON data to the API, we can't use application/json header
in the front-end. We need to use the 'FormData' class provided by the browser JS.
We create a new instance of that and append data to it and send that instance as
body of the payload.

Check docs of respective front-end frameworks to do specific tweeks.
