Static files:
    Files, whose contents won't be modified or affected by our code. Files like
    CSS, Front-End JS, Images, etc. don't change after they are deployed.

    Also, usually they are safe to be made available to public without any fear
    of compromising the security of app.

    So, to serve such files, we create a directory named 'public' in the root of
    the application. Can be named anything but convention is 'public'. Then we
    store all the static files in that directory in whatever structure we like.
    For example, all static CSS in 'public/css' and all static images in 'public/images'
    and all frontend JS in 'public/js', etc.

    Then, we need to tell express that this folder is static and any request
    to access these files should be granted. To do that, we do the following in
    app.js:

          app.use(express.static('public'));

    The above line will register the directory as static files container.

    Now, if I request a file like: '/css/style.css', then express will look in all
    the registered static files containers, in our case 'public', and then return
    the first matched file's content as response.

    So, in the HTML, we can use the styles as follows:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
