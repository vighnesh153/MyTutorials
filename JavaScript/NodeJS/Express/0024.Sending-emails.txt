Creating our own mail server is a very complicated task and there can be many
security, scalability and many other issues. So, we use a third party mail server.

Popular examples are SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.


Installation:
	npm i -S nodemailer							// To handle mail related tasks
	npm i -S nodemailer-sendgrid-transport		// To integrate SendGrid with nodemailer.


Setup:
	const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
	const sendgridTransport = require('nodemailer-sendgrid-transport');

	const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(sendgridTransport({
		auth: {
			api_key: 'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY'
		}
	}));


Usage:
	transporter.sendMail({
		to: 'TO_EMAIL',
		from: 'FROM_EMAIL',
		subject: 'SUBJECT',
		html: '<h1>Hello</h1>'
	}).then(someCallback);

NOTE: Learn more about SendGrid on its docs.
