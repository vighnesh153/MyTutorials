Creating our own mail server is a very complicated task and there can be many
security, scalability and many other issues. So, we use a third party mail server.

Popular examples are SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.


Following example uses SendGrid email service for sending emails

Installation:
	npm i -S @sendgrid/mail


Usage:
	const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

	sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
	const msg = {
		to: 'vighnesh.raut13@gmail.com',
		from: 'support@vighnesh153.com',
		subject: 'Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun',
		text: 'and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js',
		html: '<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js</strong>',
	};
	sgMail.send(msg).then(_ => {
		console.log("Sent.")
	});
