We store all the dynamic HTML files or the templates inside the views directory.
But if we decide to store them in some other directory, then we need to tell express
to look for the templates in that directory. We do that by setting value to a
special configuration value.

Let's say, we store all the templates in a 'public_templates' directory. Then,
we do as follows to tell express to use templates from that directory.
  app.set('views', 'public_templates');
  // By default, the value of 'views' in configuration is 'views'.
  // So, if we store the templates in 'views' directory, we don't need to configure
  // in express as it is already configured, by default.
