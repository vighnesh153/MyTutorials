Create a 'views' directory in the root of the application. Can be named anything
but conventionally, 'views' because of the MVC. Create HTML files in the 'views'
directory and write HTML code in it.

To serve from '/routes/someRoute.js':
    const path = require('path');
    const router = require('express').Router();

    router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'views', 'index.html'));
    });

__dirname -> directory of the current file. in the above example, '/users/vraut/......../project-name/routes'
Then we go one level down, ie. to the project directory and then in 'views' directory
then finally get the 'index.html' file. We use 'path.join' so that this path works on all OS



BETTER WAY OF GETTING THE ROOTDIR:
  Create a separate directory named 'util'. In that, create a file 'root-dir.js'.
  In that, do the following:

    module.exports = require.main.path;
    // require.main contains all the meta information of the main file.
    // A main file is a file that is the entry point of the application and is
    // run directly from the CLI.


  Then in the routes files,
      const path = require('path');
      const router = require('express').Router();
      const rootDir = require('root-dir');

      router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
        res.sendFile(path.join(rootDir, 'views', 'index.html'));
      });
