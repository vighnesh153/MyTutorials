var obj = JSON.parse('{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}');

console.log(obj.name);  // outputs: John
console.log(obj.age);  	// outputs: 30
console.log(obj.city);  // outputs: New York

NOTE: If any of the values is a date, then it won't be parsed as a 'Date' object, but as a string.
	  We have to manually convert it to a 'Date' object by passing its value as follows:
	  		let today = new Date(obj.date);  // obj.date is the string representation of 'Date'
