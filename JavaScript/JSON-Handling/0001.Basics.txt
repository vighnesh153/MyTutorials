JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.


Why use JSON?
	1. Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a
	   data format by any programming language.
	2. JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native
	   JavaScript objects: JSON.parse(). So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you
	   can use it like any other JavaScript object.

NOTE: Using JSON allows us to work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing
and translations.
