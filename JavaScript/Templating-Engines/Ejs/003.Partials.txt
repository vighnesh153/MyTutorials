We store all those to-be-included (like navbar, footer, etc) templates in 'views/includes'


To use another template in the current file:
	<%- include('includes/header.ejs') %>
NOTE: 'include' keyword acts the same way it acts in C++. It copy-pastes the content
		of the file, it is including, at its location. (It basically replaces itself
		with the content of the file)
