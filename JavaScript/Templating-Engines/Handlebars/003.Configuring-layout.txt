app.engine('handlebars', expressHandlebars({
	layoutsDir: 'views/layouts',		// this is by default 'views/layouts'
	defaultLayout: 'main-layout',		// Now, we need to have a default layout named 'main-layout' in 'views/layouts'
										// It is also a mandate to set this value if we wish to use layouts in the application
	extname: 'handlebars',				// Extension of the handlebars layout
}));

// Now, all the pages will use this default layout. To disable this for a particular page,
// send a 'layout: false' along with other data to the render function which will make it not
// Use the default layout.



In the layout file,

	1. for class:
		<h1 class="{{#if displayClass}}someClass{{/if}}"> Hello </h1>

	2. For placeholder:
		{{{ somePlaceholder }}}
		NOTE: We can only have one placeholder for a layout in handlebars

		In the file, in which we are planning to use the layout with placeholder,
		we only add that HTML in the file that needs to be injected in the placeholder
		of the layout
