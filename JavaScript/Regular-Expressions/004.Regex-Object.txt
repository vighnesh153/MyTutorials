In JavaScript, the RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods.



Using test():
	It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.

		var patt = /e/;
		patt.test("The best things in life are free!");
		// returns 'true' as there is 'e' in the string



Using exec():
	It searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text as an object.
	If no match is found, it returns an empty (null) object.

		/e/.exec("The best things in life are free!");
