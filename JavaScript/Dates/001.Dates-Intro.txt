JavaScript DATE OBJECT lets us work with dates.
    let d = new Date();


JavaScript Date Output:
    By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string:
    Fri Sep 27 2019 14:57:11 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)


Creating Date Objects:
    new Date()
    new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
    new Date(milliseconds)
    new Date(date string)
                example: let d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");


NOTE: JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11.
      January is 0. December is 11.


In the date object:
    7 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order)
    6 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second
    5 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, and minute
    4 numbers specify year, month, day, and hour
    3 numbers specify year, month, and day
    2 numbers specify year and month
    NOTE: You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter it will be treated as milliseconds.


NOTE: JavaScript stores dates as number of milliseconds since January 01, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).


DISPLAY DATES IN HTML:
    d.toString()
    d.toUTCString()
    d.toDateString()



Comparing Date objects:
    comparing date objects using comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) is supported.
