JavaScript Date Input
    There are generally 3 types of JavaScript date input formats:
    Type	                Example
    ISO Date	           "2015-03-25" (The International Standard)
    Short Date	           "03/25/2015"
    Long Date	           "Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015"



NOTE: The ISO format follows a strict standard in JavaScript.
      The other formats are not so well defined and might be browser specific.



JAVASCRIPT ISO DATES:
    ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times.
    The ISO 8601 syntax (YYYY-MM-DD) is also the preferred JavaScript date format.

    ISO dates can be written without specifying the day (YYYY-MM):
        var d = new Date("2015-03");

    ISO dates can be written without month and day (YYYY):
        var d = new Date("2015");

    ISO dates can be written with added hours, minutes, and seconds (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ):
        var d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00Z");
            Date and time is separated with a capital T.
            UTC time is defined with a capital letter Z.
            If you want to modify the time relative to UTC, remove the Z and add +HH:MM or -HH:MM instead.
        NOTE: Omitting T or Z in a date-time string can give different results in different browsers.


TIME ZONES:
    When setting a date, without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone.
    When getting a date, without specifying the time zone, the result is converted to the browser's time zone.


JavaScript Short Dates:
    var d = new Date("03/25/2015");
    NOTE: In some browsers, months or days with no leading zeroes may produce an error:


JavaScript Long Dates:
    var d = new Date("Mar 25 2015");
        or
    var d = new Date("25 Mar 2015");
        or
    var d = new Date("March 25 2015");
        or
    var d = new Date("25 March 2015");

    Commas are ignored. Names are case insensitive:
    var d = new Date("JANUARY, 25, 2015");


Date Input - Parsing Dates:
    If you have a valid date string, you can use the Date.parse() method to convert it to milliseconds.
    Date.parse() returns the number of milliseconds between the date and January 1, 1970:
        let milliseconds = Date.parse("March 21, 2012");
        let date = new Date(milliseconds);
