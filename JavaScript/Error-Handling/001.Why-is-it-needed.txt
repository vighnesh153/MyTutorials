When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur.
Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.



Example:
	<p id="demo"></p>

	<script>
	try {
		adddlert("Welcome guest!");
	}
	catch(err) {
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err.message;
	}
	</script>


	JAVASCRIPT CATCHES 'adddlert' AS AN ERROR, AND EXECUTES THE CATCH CODE TO HANDLE IT.
