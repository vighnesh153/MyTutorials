When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message.
The technical term for this is: JavaScript will throw an exception (throw an error).

NOTE: JavaScript will actually create an Error object with two properties: name and message.


The throw Statement:
	The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.
	Technically you can throw an exception (throw an error).
	The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object:
		throw "Too big";    // throw a text
		throw 500;          // throw a number


NOTE: If you use throw together with try and catch, you can control program flow and generate
	  custom error messages.
