The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The JavaScript statements try and catch come in pairs:
	try {
	  // Block of code to try
	}
	catch(err) {
	  // Block of code to handle errors
	}
