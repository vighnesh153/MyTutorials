To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:

	xhttp.open("GET", "some_url", true);
	xhttp.send();


NOTE: REQUESTS CAN BE MADE TO ANY WEBSITE, WEB-API, OR A FILE ON SERVER. (Basically, requests can
	  be made to anything, that is hosted)


GET OR POST?
	GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

	However, always use POST requests when:
		1. A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server).
		2. Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations).
		3. Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and
		   secure than GET.


GET Requests:
		xhttp.open("GET", "www.some_url.com/demo_get2.asp?fname=Henry&lname=Ford", true);
	OR  xhttp.open("GET", "www.some_url.com/demo_get.asp?t=" + Math.random(), true);
	OR  xhttp.open("GET", "www.some_url.com/demo_get.asp", true);  // We may get a cached result
																   // using this. So use the
																   // immediate URL above to
																   // generate an unique URL, so we
																   // don't get the cached result.

	xhttp.send();


POST Requests:
		xhttp.open("POST", "demo_post.asp", true);
		xhttp.send();


		To POST data like an HTML form, add an HTTP header with setRequestHeader(). Specify the
		data you want to send in the send() method:

			xhttp.open("POST", "ajax_test.asp", t`rue);
			xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
			xhttp.send("fname=Henry&lname=Ford");`
