1. new XMLHttpRequest() =>  creates a new XMLHttpRequest object.

2. abort() => The XMLHttpRequest.abort() method aborts the request if it has
              already been sent. When a request is aborted, its readyState is
              changed to XMLHttpRequest.UNSENT (0) and the request's status
              code is set to 0.

              For example:

              var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(),
              method = "GET",
              url = "https://developer.mozilla.org/";
              xhr.open(method, url, true);

              xhr.send();

              if (OH_NOES_WE_NEED_TO_CANCEL_RIGHT_NOW_OR_ELSE) {
                  xhr.abort();
              }

3. getAllResponseHeaders()  => Returns header information

4. getResponseHeader() =>	Returns specific header information

5. open(method, url, async, user, psw)  =>	Specifies the request

                                            method: the request type GET or POST
                                            url: the file location
                                            async: true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous)
												   (SHOULD ALWAYS BE SET TO TRUE)
												   By sending asynchronously, the JavaScript does
												   not have to wait for the server response, but
												   can instead:
														1. execute other scripts while waiting for
														   server response
														2. deal with the response after the
														   response is ready

												   Sometimes async = false are used for quick
												   testing. You will also find synchronous requests
												   in older JavaScript code. Since the code will
												   wait for server completion, there is no need for
												   an onreadystatechange function. We can directly
												   use xmlHttpRequestObject.response.

                                            user: optional user name
                                            psw: optional password

6. send() => Sends the request to the server
             Used for GET requests

7. send(string)	 => Sends the request to the server.
                    Used for POST requests

8. setRequestHeader('header_name', 'value') =>	Adds a header_name/value pair to
                                            	the header to be sent
