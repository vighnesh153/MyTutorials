The Parallel.Invoke method provides a convenient way to run any number of
arbitrary statements concurrently. Just pass in an Action delegate for each item of work.
The easiest way to create these delegates is to use lambda expressions.
The lambda expression can either call a named method or provide the code inline.


Parallel.Invoke(() => DoSomeWork(), () => DoSomeOtherWork());


NOTE: THE NUMBER OF TASK INSTANCES THAT ARE CREATED BEHIND THE SCENES BY INVOKE IS NOT NECESSARILY
	  EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF DELEGATES THAT ARE PROVIDED. THE TPL MAY EMPLOY VARIOUS OPTIMIZATIONS,
	  ESPECIALLY WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF DELEGATES.
