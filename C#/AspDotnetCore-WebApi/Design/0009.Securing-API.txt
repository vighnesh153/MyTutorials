Locking down the API:
	1. APIs and Security
	2. Cross Domain Security
	3. Authentication/Authorization
	4. Security considerations during design
	5. Types of API Security


APIs and Security:
	When to use security for an API:
		1. when using private and personalized data
		2. when sending sensitive data across the 'wire'
		3. when using credentials of any kind
		4. when trying to protect against overuse of our servers
	Protect our API:
		1. Server Infrastructure Security(Hardware and all)
			- Should be taken care by the Web Service provider
		2. Secure In-Transit
			- SSL is almost always appropriate
			- Cost of SSL is worth the expense
		3. Secure the API itself
			- Cross Origin Security
			- Authentication/Authorization
