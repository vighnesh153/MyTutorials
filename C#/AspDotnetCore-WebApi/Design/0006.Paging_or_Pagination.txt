Pagination(Paging): It is a way in which we only display limited data to the client/requester to avoid
cluttering the client-side with tons and tons of data.


So, if a user has to view his transactions made by him in his bank account, we can display, 10 at a time,
to the user, and if he clicks next/previous, we can show him his transactions accordingly.


So, to do pagination in REST APIs, we usually pass the following 2 URL parameters:
	page=121
	page_size=10
The purpose of this is that if there are, let's say, 1 million records, and the user is on the 1st page,
and he wishes to view his oldest records, we don't want him to repeatedly click on 'next' to reach the end.
It will take him forever to reach the last page.

So, REST demands us to create the pagination in such a way that the above 2 URL parameters are present,
and user/client can access any page and with any size, by just modifying them and sending a request to
that URI.
