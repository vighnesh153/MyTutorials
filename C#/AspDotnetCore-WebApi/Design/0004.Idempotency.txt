Idempotent: Operations should result in same side effect.

REST APIs should have Idempotency in the following types of requests:
	GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

However, POST should not be Idempotent in nature. For e.g., if a user is posted earlier, posting the same 
user again should result in an error or some warning or indication.
