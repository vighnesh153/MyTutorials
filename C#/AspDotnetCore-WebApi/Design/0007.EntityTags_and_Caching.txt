Entity Tag (ETag): It is a parameter that is sent to the client in the Response Header.

It is a tag number that is used to identify the cache age.

When we make a request, the server sends this entity tag in the response.
		ETag: "237467283468237462387"

When we make the same request, we send this tag as well, by adding it to the request header as:
		If-None-Match: "237467283468237462387"

The server gets this tag and checks if tag has been updated. If not, then the server sends just
the following 'GET 304 Not Modified' back to the client, so no data is sent again as the client
already has that data.

But if the data at server-side is modified, its tag at the server-side is also modified. And if
the client makes a request, server notices that the client has stale/ancient data. So, the server
sends the new data to the client and also the new ETag.

In REST API, if the client sends an update by modifying an old record, then the server should reject
the modification and respond with error.


There are two types of Caching:

1. Strong caching
2. Weak caching


Strong Caching: Data that doesn't get modified for a long time. For e.g., YouTube container/template
				of homepage.

Weak Caching: Data that may get modified frequently. Contents displayed on the YouTube Homepage or
			  on the Subscriptions page.


By default, all ETags are strong. To make an ETag weak (which would mean that the data sent may get
modified soon), server appends the tag with 'W/'
e.g., ETag: W/"237467283468237462387"
