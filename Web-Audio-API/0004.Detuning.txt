Detuning:
	Going out of tune.

	Units:
		cent => 1 octave / 1200

		Examples:
		1. wave with freq = 200 and detune = 1200 is same as wave with freq = 400 and detune 0
			because 1 octave is doubling of the frequency.

Formula:
	if freq = 200 and detune = 100,
	then the computedOscillatedFrequency will be 200 * Math.pow(2, 100 / 1200);

	In more general terms:
		if frequency = f and detune = d,
		then computedOscillatedFrequency = f * Math.pow(2, d / 1200);

Change the detune value:
	oscillator.detune.value = 21;
