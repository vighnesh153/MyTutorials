A file, that conventionally contains declarations and other 'library' include statements.
Whatever we add to a header, is directly copy/pasted to the source code on the line where
it is included during compile time.

To include a custom header file, in a source file:
# include "header_file_name.h"

At the top of the header file, we add '#pragma once'.
It means that, if we are including same libraries in different headers,
and if be include those headers in a single source file, it won't cause conflicts
because of including same library or header more than once.


NOTE: Standard library Header files that end with '.h' extension are C standard library header
	  files. So, Those who designed C++ decided that the C++ standard library header files won't
	  need a '.h' extension. In fact, they won't even have an extension. So, this separates C
	  standard library header files from C++ standard library header files.
	  THIS CONVENTION IS USUALLY FOLLOWED BY STANDARD LIBRARY HEADER FILES.
