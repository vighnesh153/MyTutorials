A file, that conventionally contains declarations and other 'library' include statements.
Whatever we add to a header, is directly copy/pasted to the source code on the line where 
it is included during compile time.

To include a custom header file, in a source file:
# include "header_file_name.h"

At the top of the header file, we add '#pragma once'.
It means that, if we are including same libraries in different headers, 
and if be include those headers in a single source file, it won't cause conflicts 
because of including same library or header more than once.
