type 					size (in bytes)
						(size usually depends on the compiler we are using)

short: 					2
int 					4
long					4
long long				8
char					1
float					4
double 					8
bool 					1


BY DEFAULT, ALL ARE SIGNED.

Add 'unsigned' to make them go from 0 to 2^size
else it is assumed 'signed', -2^size to 2^(size-1)-1


void => for functions: no need to return anything


'bool' has one byte of storage because it is not easy to access individual bits. So, C++ standard
setters declared that 'bool' should be at least 1 byte.
