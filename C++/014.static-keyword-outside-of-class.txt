static int a;
static void PrintPrint() {}

The above will be scoped to the file in which they are defined in. In simple words,
no other file will be able to access them even if they appear to be global in the file in
which they are defined in.




Local Static: 'static' inside of a function:
	void ok() {
		static int a = 0;
		cout << a++ << endl;
	}

	int main() {
		ok();	// 0
		ok();	// 1
		ok();	// 2

		cout << a << endl;	// Error. undefined symbol 'a'
	}

	// static variable declared inside of a function, doesn't go out of scope
	// even if the function's execution is terminated. It basically means that,
	// the variable is made global in the file, and is scoped to this function.
