# include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello";
	std::cout << std::endl;
	std::cout << 1 + 2;
	return 0;    //  OPTIONAL: ONLY FOR MAIN FUNCTION
}

NOTE: THE MAIN FUNCTION IS THE ONLY FUNCTION THAT DOESN'T NEED TO
	  RETURN ANYTHING EVEN IF THE RETURN TYPE IS NOT VOID


std: It is a standard namespace that has many standard user-defined types like 'cout', 'cin'
cout: It is a user-defined type of 'ostream' class. It has an operator overload for left shift (<<)
cin : It is a user-defined type of 'istream' class. It has an operator overload for right shift (>>)

NOTE: 'cout' AND 'cin' OBJECTS ARE DECLARED AND INITIALIZED IN THE IOSTREAM LIBRARY. SO, 
	  IF WE DON'T INCLUDE IT, IT WILL THROW A COMPILE TIME ERROR

#include: It is a pre-processor directive. This one of the many pre-processors, that gets compiled 
		  at the beginning of the compilation.

endl: It refers to a newline character


using namespace std; => Adding this statement to the top makes our life easier by not needing to 
						to add 'std::' at the start of each object that belongs to the 'std' namespace.
