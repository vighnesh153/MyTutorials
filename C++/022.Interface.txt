C++ doesn't have interface keyword. However, we can use abstract classes
to create interface (pure virtual functions).

Interfaces share the same definition and uses in every language. So, won't go
into much details. Instead, just the syntax.


class Entity {
public:
    virtual string GetName() = 0;
    virtual string GetClassName() = 0;
};
