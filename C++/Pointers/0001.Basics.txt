To get address of some variable:

  int i;
  cout << &i;
  // Some hex value




To store address of some variable, we use pointers. Pointers are the ones that
store address of other variables. To store address of int variable, we use int pointer,
for float variable, we use float pointer, etc.

  int i;
  int* pI = &i;
  cout << pI;
  // Some hex value

  float f;
  float* pF = &f;
  cout << pF;
  // Some hex value

  double d;
  double* pD = &d;
  cout << pD;
  // Some hex value



To get the value from a address, we use pointer dereferencing:

  int i = 10;
  int* pI = &i;

  cout << pI;
  // Some hex value which is address of 'i'

  cout << *pI;
  // 10
