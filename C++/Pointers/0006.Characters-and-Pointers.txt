    // recommended way to store character array instead of the following.

    char* pStr = "abcde";
    // But here, pStr is pointing to the temporary memory location that was created to store "abcde".
    // So, sometimes error may be thrown when modifying the char using this pStr.
    // So, we should not use this method to create and access/modify the char array.
