Format:
  // In the src dir.
  run: go fmt ./...
  // It will format all the .go files in the directory and sub-directories recursively.

To run a file:
  go run file.go
  // builds and stores the artifact in a temp dir and runs it.


To build project (inside the project directory):
  go build
  // makes a single executable file for the entire project (cool right?)


To install project in the bin directory, run:
  go install *.go     // from within the project directory
  // It will install the project as a single executable in the bin directory in
  // the go workspace.
