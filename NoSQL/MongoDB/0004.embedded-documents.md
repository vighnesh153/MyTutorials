### Embeded documents
* We can have fields in document that are another doument.
* We can have upto 100 nested documents (in real world apps, we will hardly use 3-4 levels of nesting)
* Max. size of a document is 16MB (it is a lot as we are storing just text data).

```
db.passengers.updateMany({}, {
    $set: {
        address: {
            city: 'Pune',
            country: 'India'
        }
    }
})

db.passengers.find({
    "address.city": "Pune"
}).pretty()
```
