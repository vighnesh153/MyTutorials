A model is how some data object is going to be represented.

Creating a model:
  const Song = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: () => {
        console.log('====================================');
        console.log('New song is created...');
        console.log('====================================');
    }
  });

  // To the extend method, we pass the configuration object.

  // initialize is s callable property. This property is invoked whenever
  // a new instance of the model is created. It is basically a constructor.


To create an instance of the model, we use the new keyword.
const song = new Song();



// To convert to JSON string:
car.toJSON();



Any model object has 2 ids associated with it.
    one is 'id'. It is the that is used to sync up with the server. It is the same
    id that is used to store the model object in the server.

    second is the 'cid', which stands for client Id. It is a temporary id, that is
    assigned by backbone to a model object. It is done so that models, in the client
    side, are identified with an id which is different from that of the server.
