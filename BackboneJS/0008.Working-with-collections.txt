The 'add' method inserts the model in a collection at the end.
To insert at a specific index:
  songs.add(new Song(), { at: someIndex });

// Another method:
  songs.push(new Song());
  // is same as the following because they both push at the end.
  songs.add(new Song());
// However, with 'add', we can push at some index of our choice.




Searching for a model in collection:

    songs.where({ someAttribute: someValue });
    songs.findWhere({ someAttribute: someValue });

  // 'where' returns an array of all the matches. (like document.querySelectorAll)
  // 'findWhere' returns the first match. (like document.querySelector)



Filtering models from a collection:
    // We pass a predicate to the filter method.

    songs.filter(song => {
        return song.get('name').startsWith('a');
    });
    // Returns an array of songs whose names start with 'a'


Iterating over collections:

    songs.each(song => {
        // do something with the model object (song)
    });
