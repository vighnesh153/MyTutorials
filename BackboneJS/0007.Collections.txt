Collections: As the name suggests, collections is a Backbone feature that is used
             to group a list/group of a particular model.


Creating Collections:

  const Song = Backbone.Model.extend();

  const Songs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
      model: Song
  });

  const songs = new Songs([
      new Song({ title: 'Song 1' }),
      new Song({ title: 'Song 2' }),
      new Song({ title: 'Song 3' })
  ]);

  // Another way to add a song. 'add' method is provided by 'underscore.js'
  songs.add(new Song({ title: 'Song 4' }));


// The collections object will have a 'length' property that stores the number
// of models in its list of model. It also has a property 'models'. It is an
// array that has all the models that were added to the collection.

// To access a model at some index, we do
songs.at(0);
// instead of: songs.models[0];


// Another way to access a model from a collection is to do:
songs.get('cid-value-of-the-model');

// To remove a model from a collection:
songs.remove(songs.get('cid-value-of-the-model'));
  // OR
songs.remove(songs.at(someIndex));

 songs.pop();
 // Removes the last model from the list of models
