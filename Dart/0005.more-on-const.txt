const constructor:
	class Test {
		final String a;

		const Test({this.a});
	}


	void main() {
		final ok = Test(a: 'Dart');
		print(ok.a);
		ok.a = 'lol';	// invalid as instances of classes with const constructors, can't be modified!
		// Also, the properties of classes with const constructors should be final.
		// the const constructor don't have a body and their values are assigned using the 'this.' syntax in the constructor.
	}


It is a good practice to do the following, in FLUTTER, in most constant Widgets like mostly 'Text' etc.:
	final obj = const Test(a: 'Some string');
	// here we mark instance of 'Test' to be constant. So, in the build cycles, this
	// object won't be re-created or re-built.
