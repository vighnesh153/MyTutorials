When we run `ng serve` command the angular compiler and a server is bundled together with the files
that are being served. Here, just-in-time compilation happens. Because of this, the file sizes are
too big in this case.

So, to build an angular application for deployment in production, angular provides us with another
command:
    `ng build --prod`
By running the above command, angular files are highly optimized and checked for all the type-errors
which may be ignored in the files generated by the `ng serve` command. Also, all the files are compiled
before execution, it is called Ahead-of-time compilation. When dist files are generated using this
command, then the compiler and server are also not bundled with the files. The files generated are
static CSS and JS files and index.html (the single page that will be served for all routes).

These files must be deployed on a server and the server should be configured in such a way that,
for all routes requested on the server, by an user, the server should render the 'index.html'
should be rendered (Not existing route will be handled by the angular's routing).
