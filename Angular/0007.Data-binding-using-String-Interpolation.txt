In any component, we export a class from the component's typescript file. Whatever we add in that
class, like a property or method, it will be accessible in the component's HTML file using {{ }}

NOTE: Whatever that is a string or can be converted to string or evaluates to string, can be passed
	  in {{ }}

NOTE: Block statements like 'if', 'for' can't be used in it. However, ternary operator works.

Example:
	Lets say that the class that was exported has the following body signature:
		export class ServerComponent {
			name: string = "Vighnesh";
			age: number = 21;

			getRandomNumber() {
				return Math.random();
			}
		}

	In the HTML file,
		<p>My {{ "name" }} is {{ name }} and my age is {{ age }}.</p>
		<p>Random number: {{ getRandomNumber() }}</p>
