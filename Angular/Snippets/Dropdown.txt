import {Directive, ElementRef, HostBinding, HostListener} from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appDropdown]'
})
export class DropdownDirective {
  @HostBinding('class.open') isOpen = false;
  @HostListener('document:click', ['$event']) toggleOpen(event: Event) {
    this.isOpen = this.elRef.nativeElement.contains(event.target) ? !this.isOpen : false;
  }
  constructor(private elRef: ElementRef) {}
}


NOTE: The above code will toggle 'open' class on the HTML element on which, this directive is used.
	  'open' class can have something like 'display: none' so that the dropdown hides and shows up
	  based on the boolean value assigned to 'isOpen' property. The above code will toggle the
	  dropdown, not just by clicking on the 'toggle' button, but if the user clicks anywhere outside
	  the region, then the dropdown will close.
