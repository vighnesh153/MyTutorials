// Some component that is passing its variable, 'details', that is passing data to 'app-server'
// component. The data is bound to 'someVariable' of 'app-server' component.
<app-server [someVariable]="details"></app-server>


// The app-server component
import { Input } from '@angular/core';

export class ServerComponent {
  @Input()
  someVariable;

  constructor() {
  }
}

NOTE: To make the property of the component's class available to be bound by the calling component,
	  we need to decorate that property with '@Input()'.
