In a component, we export that component's class which has a decorator that takes an object as an
argument which has a property 'selector'.


The selector property is a CSS-style selector. Whichever HTML element matches with the selector, all
the HTML template code and styles are inserted into and applied to it.

Example:
	selector: "server"
	<server></server>

	selector: "[server]"
	<div server></div>

	selector: ".server"
	<div class="server"></div>


NOTE: Id selector and pseudo-class selectors like hover, etc. don't work here.
