NOTE: Used in a directive.

Its job is to bind events to HTML elements or Angular components in which the directive is used.
It is a decorator, to which, we pass a HTML event name as a string and it is decorated around a
method which is called when that event happens. This way, if multiple elements across different
components and modules have same behavior on some event, then we can just add this directive to
those elements and the behavior will be replicated without code duplication.

example:

	import {Directive, HostListener} from '@angular/core';

	@Directive({
	  selector: '[appTestDirective]'
	})
	export class TestDirectiveDirective {

	  @HostListener('click')
	  onclick(eventData: Event) {
	    console.log('Clicked (from directive): ' + Math.random());
	  }
	}
