Services a just classes that help us to:
1. NOT REPEAT OURSELVES. We can have the common code sit at a central place instead of building a
   library or npm module.
2. Pass data amongst components by avoiding the need of event bindings and event capturing to pass
   data from one component to its parent and then anywhere in the same fashion.



Basic service:
	export class LoggingService {
		logStatus(status: string) {
			console.log(status);
		}
	}

	The name of the service should follow the convention: 'ServiceName.service.ts'
