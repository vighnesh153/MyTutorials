Directives are instructions in the DOM.

We have already used the directive.
Example:
	<p someCustomDirective>
		Hello
	</p>

	In the component.ts file, we have a @Directive decorator instead of a @Component decorator
	in which we specify the selector value to be: someCustomDirective


NOTE: Whenever we enclose some directive in a square bracket, then its value expression in quotes
	  will be evaluated by Angular.

	eg., <h2 [disabled]="1 === 1"> Hello </h2>
		// Here, 1 === 1 will be evaluated and assigned to the HTML property 'disabled'.

		<h2 disabled="1 === 1""> Hello </h2>
		// Here, disabled's value won't be evaluated, but instead it will be '1 === 1'
