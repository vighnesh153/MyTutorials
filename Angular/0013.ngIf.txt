<p *ngIf="some-expression">Data is: {{ serverInput }}</p>

Syntax:
	*ngIf="expression"

NOTE: '*' indicates that this is a structural directive, which means that this directive modifies
	  the structure of the DOM. Also, without the '*', this won't work.

WORKING: If the expression evaluates to true, the element will be rendered. Else, the element will
		 not be rendered. Two-way data binding also works here.




ADDING ELSE PART:
	1. Easiest way is to:
		<p *ngIf="someElement"> If part</p>
		<p *ngIf="!someElement"> If part</p>

	2. Another way:
		<p *ngIf="someElement; else someMarker">Random value is greater than 0.5</p>
		<ng-template #someMarker>
			<p>Random value is less than 0.5</p>
		</ng-template>
