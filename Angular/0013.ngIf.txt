<p *ngIf="some-expression">Data is: {{ serverInput }}</p>

Syntax:
	*ngIf="expression"

NOTE: '*' indicates that this is a structural directive, which means that this directive modifies
	  the structure of the DOM. Also, without the '*', this won't work.

WORKING: If the expression evaluates to true, the element will be rendered. Else, the element will
		 not be rendered. Two-way data binding also works here.
