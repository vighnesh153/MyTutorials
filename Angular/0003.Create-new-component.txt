Command:
	ng generate component component-name

	Shortcut:
		ng g c component-name


When we run the above command, angular creates a component in the 'angular-app-name/src/app/'.

'app' is the root component of the angular-app. And new components are created in it.

After that, we need to add component's class's name in the 'angular-app-name/src/app/app.module.ts'
file. That file has a class that is being exported at the end. That class has a decorator which takes
in an object as an argument. That object has a property called 'declarations' and the value of that
property is an array of components. So, append the component's class's name to that array.
The command used above should do it automatically but if it doesn't then we can add it manually.

NOTE: If the component's name is 'server', then the component's class's name will be 'ServerComponent'.
	  It is angular's convention.
