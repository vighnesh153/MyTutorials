ngClass is also an attribute directive. It takes a JS object with a class-name as the property or key
	of that object, and its value being boolean.
	NOTE: some expressions won't work as the value in this case, so it will be better if a method
		  is called as a value or some boolean property of the component is being referred.


Example:
	<h2 [ngClass]="{ test: someComponentObjectPropertyOrMethodCall }"> Hello </h2>

	If 'someComponentObjectPropertyOrMethodCall' returns true, then the class 'test' will be
	added to the classList of that 'h2', else not.
