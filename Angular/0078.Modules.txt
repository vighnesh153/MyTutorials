Angular Modules (different from JS module):
  Modules are used to bundle up Components, Directives, Services together for Angular.
  Angular won't detect anything which is not bundled in a module.

  NOTE: AppModule is the root module.

  1. Angular analyses NgModules to understand our application and its features.
  2. Angular modules define all building blocks our app uses. (Components, Directives, Services, etc)
  3. An Angular app requires at least one module (AppModule), but it may also be split up into
      multiple modules.
  4. Core Angular Features are included in Angular modules to load them only when needed.
