<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="serverInput">


<p>Data is: {{ serverInput }}</p>


This 'ngModel' directive (more on directives later) binds our element to the mentioned variable(
component's class's property), 'serverInput' in our case.

Now, whenever we update our input element, it will be reflected in the 'p' tag and if the 'serverInput'
property is updated in the component's class, then it will be reflected both, in 'input' element and in
the 'p' element.



NOTE: For the 'ngModel' directive to work, we need to :
		import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';
	  and add 'FormsModule' to the imports[] which is the property of object, passed to the decorator
	  of our root app's component, in the app.module.ts
