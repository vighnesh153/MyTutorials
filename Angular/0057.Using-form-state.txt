Suppose, we have the following form:
	<form [ngSubmit]="onSubmit(#myForm)" #myForm="ngForm">
		<input
			type="text"
			ngModel
			name="username"
		/>

		<input
			type="email"
			ngModel
			name="email"
		/>

		<button type="Submit">Submit</button>
	</form>

Now, angular adds some classes to elements based on the 'myForm' value.
If one input has 'valid' = false, then the 'form' element and that input element will get a class
value of 'ng-invalid'.

Similarly, other classes are 'ng-touched', etc.

So, to display a warning below a input that was touched but no valid input was provided:
In CSS file:
	input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
		border: 1px solid red;
	}


To display a warning message below that 'input' element, then we do the following:
	<input
		type="email"
		ngModel
		name="email"
		#email="ngModel"		// Note, we use 'ngModel' type to cast the input to.
	/>
	<p
		*ngIf="!email.valid && email.touched"
	>Please enter a valid email!</p>
