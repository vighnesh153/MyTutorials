To reset a form, we do the following:
	export class SomeComponent {
		@ViewChild('myForm', { static: false }) submitForm: NgForm;

		onSubmit() {
			// Do something with the form data

			this.submitForm.reset();
			// This will not only just empty all the fields, but all the validations will also be
			// reset, like: ng-touched will be false and all. It is sort of like reloading the
			// form component.

			// This also works with Reactive Forms

			this.submitForm.setValue({
				...
			});
			// This way, we can reset to some specific values
			NOTE: 'setValue' doesn't reset all other properties of the form. So, reset the form entirely,
				  first invoke 'reset' and then invoke 'setValue'.
		}
	}
