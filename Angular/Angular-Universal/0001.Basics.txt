A normal Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to
user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that
later get bootstrapped on the client. This means that the application generally renders more
quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.

You typically use Angular Universal to pre-render Angular pages on the server. Once the app then
runs on the client, it's a normal SPA again.
Server-side rendering (SSR) can make sense because of SEO considerations
(crawler should see what your users see) or because you want to deliver a finished page to your
users (rather than creating the page in the browser).
