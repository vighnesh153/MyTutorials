A normal Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to
user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that
later get bootstrapped on the client. This means that the application generally renders more
quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.
