Grouping form data can be useful to accessing forms in a better way. Related data will be together.
And not all the selected elements will be populated direectly in the ngForm's 'value' property.
Also, in the 'control' property of 'ngForm', instead of individual FormControl elements for username
and email, refer the following example, they will be under 'userData' FormControl.

Examples of grouping:
	secret question and answer 1,
	secret question and answer 2,
	username and password,
	etc.

Example:
	<div
		ngModelGroup="userData"
		#userData="ngModelGroup"
	>
		<input
			type="text"
			name="username"
			ngModel
			required
		>
		<input
			type="email"
			name="email"
			ngModel
			required
		>
	</div>
	<p
		*ngIf="!userData.valid && userData.touched"
	>
		User Data is not vaild!
	</p>
