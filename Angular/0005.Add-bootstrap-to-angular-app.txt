Command:
	npm install --save bootstrap


In the 'angular-app/angular.json' file, register the bootstrap's files to all the components by
adding it to the following object's property:
	From root object follow the following properties:
		"projects" => "angular-app-name" => "architect" => "build" => "options" => "styles". Now
		the value of the above object properties structure will be an array.
		Add "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" to the array.
		NOTE: Add the above string at the beginning of the array because we want our global styles
			  to be able to modify/override the bootstrap styles.


Now, we can directly add bootstrap styles by adding bootstrap classes to the components.
