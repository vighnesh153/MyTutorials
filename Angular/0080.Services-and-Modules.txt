If services are required application-wide, then they can be provided in the AppModule's provider
array or in the Eagerly loaded module or using 'provided' in 'root' injectable. But if they can be
accessed application-wide, then we should use 'provided' in 'root' injectable.


If we add a service in the providers array of a lazy-loaded module, then the module will get a
separate instance of the service and all its children will get the same instance. This should only be
done if we want a service to be scoped to a particular module.
