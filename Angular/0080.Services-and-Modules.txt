If services are required application-wide, then they can be provided in the AppModule's provider
array or in the Eagerly loaded module or using 'provided' in 'root' injectable. But if they can be
accessed application-wide, then we should use 'provided' in 'root' injectable.


If we add a service in the providers array of a lazy-loaded module, then the module will get a
separate instance of the service and all its children will get the same instance. This should only be
done if we want a service to be scoped to a particular module.


If we add a service in the providers of a shared module, then whichever module imports the shared
module, the shared module will use a different instance for all the different imports. It is
obviously because, when we import a module, it is initialized again. So, adding service to the
providers of a shared module should only be done, if we need the shared module to use different
instances of the service when the shared module is used in a different module by importing the
shared module.
