In some service's file

	import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

	import { LoggingService } from './logging.service';

	@Injectable()				// If this is not added, then it will throw an error
	export class AccountService {
		accounts = [];

		constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService) {}
	}

NOTE: For this to work, the service's class should be added to the app.module's providers array in
	  'NgModule' decorator.
