Operators are basically some pure functions, that can be applied to a input to transform it to some
other form.

	import { map, filter } from 'rxjs/operators'


Usage:
	this.observer = someObservable()
						.pipe(
							map(data => 'Some Data: ' + data),
							filter(data => data.length > 10)
						)
						.subscribe(data => {
							console.log(data);
						});

	NOTE: 'pipe' method can take any number of operators. Those operators are applied linearly. What
		  I mean by that is first, the map is applied, and then filter is applied. Then, that transformed
		  data is passed as an argument to the function, passed as an argument to 'subscribe' method.
