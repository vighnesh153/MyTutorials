In Angular, the dependency injection is hierarchical. If a component has used Dependency injection,
then all the components we use inside it will get the same instance of the service.

To achieve this, in the children component's class's decorator, we shouldn't add the 'ServiceName'
class's reference in the providers array. It should be added in the parent's component's decorator's
providers' array. But the constructor initialization along with the type, should be there.

If we add the 'ServiceName' class in the providers array of the component, that component and all the
components used inside it as children, will get a new instance of the 'ServiceName' class.
