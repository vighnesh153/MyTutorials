NgRx helps with state management for bigger angular applications.

Handling state with services in smaller to medium size apps is cool, but as app gets bigger and
bigger, it can become difficult to maintain state because it will be hard to find particular
information from the large pool of services.

'rxjs' solves small part of the problem by providing 'Subjects' and 'BehaviorSubjects', and it is
also pretty good, even in bigger apps, but it requires that the app is structured well from the start.

Issues with 'rxjs':
    1. State can be updated anywhere.
    2. State is (possibly) mutable.

NgRx solves these problems:
    NgRx -> Angular's implementation of Redux

Here, all the information is stored in a single object called the store and it is the single source
of truth as it manages the entire application state.
