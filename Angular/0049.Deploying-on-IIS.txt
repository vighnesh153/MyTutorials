1. Enable IIS on windows: https://www.itnota.com/install-iis-windows/

2. Build the Angular project for production:
	ng build --prod

3. Copy all the artifacts from the dist/project-name/ to the directory which will be hosted on IIS

4. Create a website in IIS and set its port number and 'path-to-directory' that will be served.

5. THIS STEP IS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT DEEP LINKING EVEN IF THE LINK DOESN'T EXIST ON THE SERVER AS
   ANGULAR SERVES ONLY SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS
   Install URL re-write from here: https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite
   We will use this feature to make the server, serve the '/' route's content for whatever URL we type.
   Thus, once we get access to index.html, it will then have JS that will take care of the route.

6. Restart IIS. On the site, we just added, select the 'URL re-write' option and add a rule. That
   rule should redirect/rewrite from any URL to '/'.

6. ALTERNATE TO ABOVE STEP 6. After doing step 5, manually make a file in the hosted folder, named
   web.config. Add the following contents into it.
		<system.webServer>
			<rewrite>
				<rules>
					<rule name="Angular Routes" stopProcessing="true">
						<match url=".*" />
						<conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
							 <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
							 <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
						</conditions>
						<action type="Rewrite" url="/index.html" />
					</rule>
				</rules>
			</rewrite>
		</system.webServer>

NOTE: If unsuccessful, just search on the internet for a solution.
