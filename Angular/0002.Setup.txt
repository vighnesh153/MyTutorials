To install:
	npm install -g @angular/cli



To create an app:
	ng new my-first-app



Then, navigate to that app directory:
	cd my-first-app



To run development server:
	ng serve

	ng serve --o
	// same as above, but also opens the localhost:4200 in the browser



To get static files for production:
	ng build --prod
	// This will compile the entire angular app and build static files in the 'dist' folder in the
	// project's root directory. Those files will be highly optimized.
