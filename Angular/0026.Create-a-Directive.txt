Command:
	ng generate directive directive-name

	Shortcut:
		ng g d directive-name


This creates a directive with name = 'directive-name'.
In the 'directive-name.directive.ts' file, the following code is found:
	import { Directive } from '@angular/core';

	@Directive({
		selector: '[appTestDirective]'         // CSS type selector which selects all elements that
											   // have 'appTestDirective' directive.
	})
	export class TestDirectiveDirective {
		constructor() { }
	}

We also need to register this directive in the parent module in the 'declarations' property alongside
components.

To access the element that has this directive, in the constructor of the directive:
	constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) {
		this.elementRef.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
	}
