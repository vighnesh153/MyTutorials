Prefixed with '*' because it is a structural directive.



In component's class,
	topics = ['Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Computer Science']

In HTML file,
	<h1 *ngFor="let topic of topics"> {{ topic }} </h1>



To get the index,
	*ngFor="let topic of topics; let i = index"
	// Now, 'i' will hold the index value of each 'topic' in 'topics'.
	NOTE: 'index' is a reserved word in the above context
