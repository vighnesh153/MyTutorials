The structural directives start with '*' when used on the HTML elements or our components. It is
because angular needs to know about them. But when we use them in 'ng-template', we don't need to
prefix them with '*' because 'ng-template' is, by default, escaped by angular. We need to instead
wrap it in '[]'.

For example:
	<div id="something" *ngIf="some_condition"> </div>
is same as
	<ng-template [ngIf]="some_condition">
		<div id="something"> </div>
	</ng-template>


NOTE: For structural directives, if we don't want to use prefix '*', then we need to use the above
	  'ng-template' syntax to achieve the similar results.
