If we need to use same transition from one state to another, then we can use 2 headed arrows:
	transition('first-state <=> second-state', animate(300))

A wild-card state:
	transition('first-state <=> *', animate(300))


Transition phases:

	// The following styles will be applied when the transition is happening
	transition('first-state <=> second-state', [
		style({
			...								// This block will be applied immediately
		}),									// as we start the transition
		animate(1000, style({
			...								// This block will be applied over the duration of 1000 ms
		}),
		animate(500)						// This block will be applied when we are switching from and to
	])										// the transition and end states

	// We can add multiple transitions styles and animate in the array.
