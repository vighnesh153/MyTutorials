'void' state is a special state that is provided by angular. We can, but should not,
override it. It is the state of the element when it is not been added to the DOM or when
it is removed from the DOM.

	transition('void => first-state', [
		style({
			...					// We need to add this because the void state doesn't have a style
		}),						// So, we add a style that will be immediately applied as the transition begins
		animate(300)			// and then will transition for 300 ms to styles of 'first-state'
	]),
	transition('* => void', [
		...
	])
