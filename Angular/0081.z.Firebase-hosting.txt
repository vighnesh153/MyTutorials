Steps:
    1. Generate dist (production build) files using `ng build --prod`.
    2. Install firebase-cli:
        sudo npm i -g firebase-tools
    3. Login in to firebase on the system using the following command (firebase account is required):
        firebase login
    4. From within the angular project, run the following command:
        firebase init
        // Select hosting and continue
    5. Choose the firebase project that you want to connect the angular project with (you need to
       create a firebase project first on the online firebase console)
    6. Select the directory that should be hosted. In this case, it will be,
        dist/<project-name>
    7. Select 'yes' for 'configure as a single page app' so that all the routes will render the
       index.html page.
    8. Select 'no' for 'existing index.html should be overwritten'.
    9. Finally, run `firebase deploy` (it will also print a URL where the project is hosted. We can
       configure the URL to be our own from within the firebase project on google firebase console.)

NOTE: Angular universal can be deployed using 'Firebase Hosting'. For that, we need to look at
      'Firebase cloud functions'.
