'ngStyle' is a attribute directive.

<h1 [ngStyle]="{ 'background-color': 'red' }"> Hello </h1>


NOTE: If we want to write the name of the CSS-properties in the CSS style way, we need to wrap them
	  in quotes. If we don't want to use quotes, we need to specify them in Camel Case.
	  	{ backgroundColor: 'red' }


Example style object that can be passed:
 {
	'background-color': 'red',
	'color': 'white',
	padding: '10px',
	width: 'fit-content'
 }


NOTE: In this case, the expression's value will be interpreted by Angular, but it won't be assigned
	  to 'ngStyle' HTML property as such HTML property doesn't exist. Instead, all the keys and
	  values will be added to the 'style' HTML property of that element separated by ';'.
