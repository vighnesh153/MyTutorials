'ngStyle' is a attribute directive.

<h1 [ngStyle]="{ 'background-color': 'red' }"> Hello </h1>


NOTE: If we want to write the name of the CSS-properties in the CSS style way, we need to wrap them
	  in quotes. If we don't want to use quotes, we need to specify them in Camel Case.
	  	{ backgroundColor: 'red' }


Example style:
 {
	'background-color': 'red',
	'color': 'white',
	padding: '10px',
	width: 'fit-content'
 }


NOTE: In this case, the expression's value will be interpreted by Angular, but it won't be assigned 
	  to 'ngStyle' HTML property as such HTML property doesn't exist. Instead, all the keys of that
	  object whose value is 'true', will be added to the classList of that 'h1'.
