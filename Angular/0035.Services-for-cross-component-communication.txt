Let's say 2 components are using a service. Now communication between them is a lot easier.

Add a property, named 'SomeEmitter', in the service and initialize it with an event emitter.

Now, to transfer data from one component, we emit an event from that component:
	this.serviceName.SomeEmitter.emit(data);

In the other component, we capture the event(Should be done in ngOnInit() method):
	this.serviceName.SomeEmitter.subscribe((data: someType) => {
		// do something;
	});
