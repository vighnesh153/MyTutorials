Preparation:
    1. Use angular environment files for storing common values like API URLS as key-value pairs.
    NOTE: DON'T PUSH SECRET KEYS OR PAID KEYS IN THE ANGULAR ENVIRONMENT FILES AS THEY MIGHT
          GET EXPOSED.
    2. Polish and test the code.
    3. Run 'ng build --prod'
    4. Deploy the artifacts on the static host server which is capable of serving static HTML, CSS
       and JS files. Either use the ready-made servers(like nginx, apache, etc.) or we can make a
       server of our own.
