Preparation:
    1. Use angular environment files for safe to store key-values.
    NOTE: DON'T PUSH SECRET KEYS OR PAID KEYS IN THE ANGULAR ENVIRONMENT FILES AS THEY MIGHT
          GET EXPOSED.
    2. Polish and test the code.
    3. Run 'ng build --prod'
    4. Deploy the artifacts on the static server which is capable of serving static HTML, CSS and JS
       files. Either use the ready-made servers or we can make a server of our own.
