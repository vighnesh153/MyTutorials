To import:
	import { Subject } from 'rxjs'

If we are using a service just to communicate between multiple components using Event Emitters, then
there is a better way to do it. Instead of initializing with EventEmitter, Initialize with Subject.

	// this.dataTransferrer = new EventEmitter<boolean>();
	this.dataTransferrer = new Subject<boolean>();
	// Data to be passed around is of type boolean.


Then instead of emitting an event, we just invoke the 'next' method.
	// this.dataTransferrer.emit(true);
	this.dataTransferrer.next(true);


Then, subscribe to it in the same way as we do to events.

Benefit of using Subject:
	Subject is a type of observable, whose state is in our control. In other observables, they,
	on their own, invoked 'next', 'error' or 'complete'. But in subject, we can invoke those methods
	outside the observables.

Subject.next() does the same like EventEmitter.emit(): It emits an event.
EventEmitter extends Subject; the implementation differences are not relevant, thus both could be
used interchangeably.
But, EventEmitter should only be used for transferring data to parent component (Not a hard and fast
rule, but conventionally). To just transfer data between components, Subject should be used (again,
conventionally).

NOTE: Subject is like a custom observable. So, on component destruction, we need to unsubscribe its
	  observer or subscription.



BehaviorSubject:
	It is also behaves like a Subject, but the difference is that if someone subscribes to it after
	an event, then it still gets the latest value.
	If one uses Subject, he will have to wait for the subject to 'next' a value if subscribed in the
	middle.

	To initialize, we initialize the constructor so that if someone subscribes to this subject,
	it has a value to start with so that he doesn't have to wait for the subject to 'next' a value.

	import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
	// Example
	this.dataTransferrer = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(null);

	CAN BE USED FOR USER(IF AUTHENTICATED, THEN 'next' THE USER INFORMATION AND STORE THE LATEST
	USER's OBJECT SO THAT NEW SUBSCRIBE TO THE USER CAN GET HIS DATA)
