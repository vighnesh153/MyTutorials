There are multiple events based on which, you would like to trigger the workflow.
To do that:


on:
	push:
		branches:
			- master
			- develop



Options for event are:
	push, pull_request, commit_comment, fork, package, etc.


Next level Options for push, pull_request:
	branches, branches-ignore, tags, etc


Next level Options for branches, branches-ignore are list of branch names.


Usually, I use these. When I use other events later, might add about them then.
