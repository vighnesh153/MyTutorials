To create a workflow, in the repository, at the root, create a '.github' directory.
In the '.github' directory, create another directory named 'workflows'.

Now, whatever workflow we want to add, we add inside that folder.

Workflow file is a yaml file:
	name-of-workflow.yml
	// Name of the file doesn't matter. You can keep it consistent with what you
	// want to do in it.

Creating a workflow:
	1. new file: first-workflow.yml

Inside the workflow (typically):
	1. Give a name
	2. Event type
	3. Jobs

To give a name:
	name: Any thing you want (should match with what the workflow is doing, typically)
