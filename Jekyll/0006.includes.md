Includes allows us to extract out certain components in a file and then use those
components anywhere. For example extract out header, footer, etc.

Steps
* Create `_includes` directory.
* Create `header.html`.

Content:
```html
<head>
    <title>{{ site.title }}</title>
</head>
<br>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: {{ include.color }}">{{ site.title }}</h1>
```

* To include the file in a layout"
```html
{% include header.html color="blue" %}
```
